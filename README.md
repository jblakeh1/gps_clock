# gps_clock
An Arduino-based GPS clock using a microcontroller with a gps attachment and a 12-neopixel ring. I based this project on Adafruit's awesome Neopixel watch: https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-geo-watch/overview

This is my first github submission, so be gentle. I'm an artist, not a programmer.

This project uses an Arduino-friendly microcontroller (the smaller, the better - I used an Adafruit Flora), with an added GPS chip to determine the time, and a 12-neopixel ring. Wiring photo can be seen here:

For the case, I used basswood and polystyrene for the face - look in the train section of the hobby shop, use an old cigar box, or find your own casing. Be creative.
