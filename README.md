# gps_clock
An Arduino-based GPS clock using a microcontroller with a gps attachment and a 12-neopixel ring. I based this project on Adafruit's awesome Neopixel watch: https://learn.adafruit.com/flora-geo-watch/overview

This is my first github submission, so be gentle. I'm an artist, not a programmer.

This project uses an Arduino-friendly microcontroller (the smaller, the better - I used an Adafruit Flora), with an added GPS chip to determine the time, and a 12-neopixel ring. Wiring photo can be seen here:

A pink/salmon color is used to display the time, hour is an orange-yellow, and the seconds blink at the top. If the signal is unavailable, the ring will be entirely blue.

I added a button to the clock to adjust the hour, as I could only get the time in global format and without any consideration for daylight savings. I wanted to provide a mechanism for adjusting the hour without plugging the clock back into a computer to make adjustments to the code.

For the case, I used basswood and polystyrene for the face - look in the train section of the hobby shop, use an old cigar box, or find your own casing. Be creative.

This clock is almost like a houseplant - you have to find the right window for it to work well. If the signal is weak, you'll mostly see a blue ring. In my office I see the time about 50% of the time.
